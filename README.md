You just need to edit the file `conversation.txt` inside the `assets` folder to set up the dialogs, the dialogs accept HTML code, so feel free to format them.

- The timming between messages is automatic depending on the words count.
- The first time it will go at normal speed.
- The second time it will go faster.

It was a speed code, I'll refactor this later.
