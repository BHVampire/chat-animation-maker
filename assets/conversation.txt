Whatever will be, will be

Don't care what anyone else thinks

You'll be okay, I promise

Just keep on keeping on

It's just a bad day, not a bad life

I'll always be there for you

I swear the breath from my lungs

You'll feel it when you know

Life is worth the risk

Live long and prosper

Believe in yourself and create your own destiny
